# Trajectory analysis
In this repo we share a method to classify trajectories based on 
- general properties, such as ergodic/non-ergodic; 
- trajectories types, such as CTRW, LW etc.
- characterisation of trajectories segments.

This work is inspired by the ANDI challenge

# Problem formulation on types of trajectories classification 

*Anomalous diffusion* can be characterized by 
MSD\propto t^{\alpha},
with \alpha \neq 1 and can be generated by a variety of stochastic processes [1], such as:
-   the Continuous-Time Random Walk (CTRW);
-   the Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM);
-   the LÃ©vy Walk (LW);
-   the Annealed Transient Time Motion (ATTM);
-   the Scaled Brownian Motion (SBM).

# Problem formulation on ergodicity testing for trajectories  

Let us assume that our system in its present state at some time t_0, while our measurement started at some later instant of time. Then the system possesses *no age*, if 
| x(t_2 - t_0) -x(t_1-t_0)|^2 = K(t_2-t_1)
or in words, whenever we start our measurement on a process, the result of this measurement only depends on the time-lag between the measurement points denoted here as K. 

There are various 
*ergodicity breaking tests*, one of them was developed in [2]. 
The main idea of ergodicity breaking and mixing estimators are based on time-averaged characteristic function of increments and Khinchins theorem about relation between ergodicity and long-time vanishing velocity of autocorrelation function of stationary process (as null model of ergodic system).

# Problem of trajectories segmentation 

As in classical time-series segmentation, an input trajectory showing a change of anomalous diffusion exponent \alpha  and/or diffusion model must be divided into two discrete segments in order to reveal the underlying properties of each.

We divide task 3 into two parts: 
    1. Search of turning point 
    2. Identifying regimes for trajectories between turning points 
    
A turning point is just a changes in direction. Such points are valuable features for the trajectory analysis because they can define trajectories in a space.
The Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm is an algorithm for reducing the number of points in a curve that is approximated by a series of points.
